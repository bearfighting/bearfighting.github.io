### Description

- You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

- The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".


```
Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

```
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

### Solution

```
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < J.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < S.length(); j++) {
                if (J.charAt(i) == S.charAt(j)) {
                    res ++;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
